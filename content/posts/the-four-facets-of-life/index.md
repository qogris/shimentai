>In **Innovation**, we seek the new,  
>Boldly shaping what might be.  
>Through **Expression**, the soul breaks through,  
>A canvas for the heart set free.  
>In **Contemplation**, we pause and know,  
>The quiet depths of mind unfold.  
>And in **Competition**, we rise and grow,  
>Pushed to greatness, fierce and bold.
>
>**Four edges firm, yet fluid in form,**  
>Together, life's true shape is born.
